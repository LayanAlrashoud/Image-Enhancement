In digital image processing, enhancement techniques are critical for improving image  quality and extracting important details. These techniques can be categorized into two  main domains: spatial domain, which involves directly manipulating pixel values, and  frequency domain, which focuses on transforming the image to highlight frequency  components.I will explore both domains. For the spatial domain, I  will use Canny edge detection to emphasize edges and histogram equalization to enhance  contrast. In the frequency domain, I will apply high-pass and low-pass filters along with  the Fourier Transform to selectively enhance or suppress specific details based on their  frequency. The dataset Iâ€™ve selected contains real and fake images of human faces, an  essential area of study due to the growing threat of Deepfakes, which pose serious risks  such as spreading misinformation, identity theft, and reputational damage. The goal of  this assignment is to compare the effectiveness of these different enhancement techniques  and determine which is better suited for detecting important features in the context of  Deepfake detection, where identifying subtle details and inconsistencies is critical to  reducing these risks.
