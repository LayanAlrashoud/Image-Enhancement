# Image-Enhancement
 1. Introduction   In digital image processing, enhancement techniques are critical for improving image  quality and extracting important details. These techniques can be categorized into two  main domains: spatial domain, which involves directly manipulating pixel values, and  frequency domain, which focuses on transforming the image to highlight frequency  components. In this assignment, I will explore both domains. For the spatial domain, I  will use Canny edge detection to emphasize edges and histogram equalization to enhance  contrast. In the frequency domain, I will apply high-pass and low-pass filters along with  the Fourier Transform to selectively enhance or suppress specific details based on their  frequency. The dataset I’ve selected contains real and fake images of human faces, an  essential area of study due to the growing threat of Deepfakes, which pose serious risks  such as spreading misinformation, identity theft, and reputational damage. The goal of  this assignment is to compare the effectiveness of these different enhancement techniques  and determine which is better suited for detecting important features in the context of  Deepfake detection, where identifying subtle details and inconsistencies is critical to  reducing these risks.  2. Methodology   Dataset  Dataset Overview:   This dataset contains real and fake images of human faces.  Dataset used: Real vs fake faces (kaggle.com)  Dataset entries: 960 images  Dataset Size: 225.79 MB  Note: I deleted some images and kept only ten in each folder to speed up the process.  Libraries used  OpenCV: I use CV for image processing tasks like reading images, applying filters,  detecting edges, and performing transformations.  NumPy: offers efficient tools for handling large arrays and performing complex  mathematical operations like Fourier Transforms.  Matplotlib: to visualize the results of my image processing steps, allowing me to display  the original images, the filtered images, and the results of different transformations in a  clear and organized way  OS: checking if image files exist  Spatial domain enhancement used   • Histogram equalization   A technique that improves an image's contrast by spreading out the intensity values  more evenly across the image.  • Canny edge detection   A method for detecting edges by finding areas where the image intensity changes  sharply, helping to outline objects and features.  Frequency domain enhancement used  • Fourier Transform -High pass  A filter that highlights the sharp details and edges in an image by letting high frequency information through and removing the smoother parts.  • Fourier Transform -Low pass  A filter that smooths the image by letting through the low-frequency information  and filtering out the sharper details.

Conclusion   After applying both spatial domain and frequency domain enhancement techniques to the  dataset of real and fake images, I observed key differences in their effectiveness.  While both Canny edge detection and the high-pass filter highlighted the edges and brought  out important details, the high-pass filter delivered better results. Canny edge detection  emphasized the edges, but it tended to remove many of the facial features, losing some  important details in the process. In contrast, the high-pass filter not only enhanced the edges  but also retained more of the image’s structure, preserving key facial features and textures,  making it more effective for identifying inconsistencies in Deepfakes.  As for histogram equalization, it performed well in improving the contrast and revealing  hidden details, which is crucial in highlighting some of the subtle differences in real and  fake images. However, the low-pass filter was less effective. Although it smoothed the  image, it reduced too many details, which I believe are critical in Deepfake detection,  where fine details play a significant role in identifying fakes.  In conclusion, while Canny edge detection and histogram equalization were useful, the  high-pass filter offered the best balance between edge enhancement and preserving  important facial details. The low-pass filter, on the other hand, was less suited for this task  as it blurred too many important details that are necessary for detecting subtle Deepfake  artifacts.  5.
